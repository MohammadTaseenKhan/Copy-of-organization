NACOM <strong>undertakes various approaches for technical and social management of resources<\/strong> of a project area.<\/p>\n<p>The major approaches that NACOM considers for natural resource management are:\u00a0 ecosystem management approach, watershed management approach, landscape management approach. We integrate community participation in resource management integrating them in all stages of project implementation (designing, implementation and monitoring) of any resource management project. We, in particular, promote community-based resource management approach.<\/p>\n<p>NACOM have implemented at least <strong>a number of natural resource management<\/strong> projects. The notable projects are, Sustainable Environment Management Project <strong>(SEMP),<\/strong> Coastal and Wetland Biodiversity management Project in Cox\u2019s-Bazar-Teknaf ECA <strong>(CWBMP<\/strong>),\u00a0 Nishorgo Support Project <strong>(NSP<\/strong>) \u2013 Co-management of Tropical Forest management Project, Conservation and Monitoring of Wildlife of Tanguar Haor, Implementation Community based Management Plan in Hakluki Haor (not lead) and\u00a0 Governance in Natural Resource Management in Improving Poverty <strong>(NRG<\/strong> project-not lead) Community Based Adaptation in the Ecologically Critical Areas through Biodiversity Conservation and Social Protection project in Teknaf Peninsula ECA and Sonadia ECA, Climate resilient Ecosystem and Livelihood (CREL), Integrating Community-based Adaptation into Afforestation and Reforestation (ICBAAR) Project, and Integrating the Sector Development Plan for RIO Conventions in Hakaluki Haor, Bangladesh; under the National Capacity Development for Implementing RIO Conventions through Environmental Governance (RIO Project). Presently, NACOM is implementing USAID\u2019s Ecosystem Conservation through Livelihood Improvement and Forest Enhancement (ECO LIFE), Implementation of Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan at Sonadia Island and as such.<\/p>\n<p>NACOM <strong>undertakes various approaches for technical management of resources<\/strong> of a project area. A particular approach is not necessarily exclusive for a particular issue or resource type, rather integration of two or more approaches are often made. The major approaches that NACOM considers are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Issue and problem-based approach:<\/strong> The degradation of natural resources is caused by various factors ranging from ecologic to socio-economic. Therefore, identification of the causes, issues and problems in resource and environmental degradation is needed to plan and take any corrective measures for restoring\/preserving the environment quality and optimizing human benefits. Therefore, <strong>an issue and problem-based approach<\/strong> is taken to identify and recognize the issues, problems and causative factors through a process of consultation and addresses such issues and problems. Such issues may be linked to resource exploitation, utilization and regeneration and other natural and human behavior\/ activities.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resource based planning approach:<\/strong> The livelihood of rural people is primarily based on exploitation and regeneration of natural resources which are often unplanned and thus causes degradation to individual resource types, i.e., fish, wildlife, plants, invertebrate, soil etc. Therefore, management of individual resource types could be credible in preserving the environment quality. Therefore, <strong>a resource-based planning approach<\/strong> is also considered to formulate strategies and action plans for managing individual resource types of the project area.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Holistic ecosystem approach: <\/strong>An ecosystem is not merely a place or habitat, rather it represents a complex interaction of its various components of which human is a part. As with other ecosystems, wetlands function in a variety of ways, interlinking of its various components. Therefore, any planned activities should consider these interlinkages, e.g. approach should be taken to maintain the integrity of ecosystem as a whole, not a part of it. The activities of the people and the ecosystem are in a state of constant interactions which ultimately determines the quality of an ecosystem. The human activities are therefore very central to the maintenance of the functional integrity of the system. Therefore, NACOM also undertakes a <strong>holistic ecosystem approach<\/strong> which integrates the ecological protection of the system and human behavior, development activities.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The major technical interventions taken by NACOM for resource management include establishment and maintenance of wildlife conservation areas and fish micro sanctuaries, rejuvenation of depleted species through restocking of wildlife and fish species, introducing wise use practices of resources, enhancement of awareness level of local people, introducing eco-friendly resource regeneration and other developmental activities, establishment of seed bank for traditional and indigenous crop varieties, plantation of indigenous species, development and maintenance of nurseries for indigenous plant, including medicinal plant species, promotion of use of medicinal plants.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Community<strong> based management approach:<\/strong> Recognizing the interlinkages between the people and the various components of ecosystem and considering the sustainability issue of the project activities, NACOM promotes <strong>community-based management with a view <\/strong>to involve the local people in planning, implementation and monitoring of the project activities. NACOM has its own strategic approach to organize and capacities the local people in natural resource management. This approach has provision for drawing together the government, public groups, private sectors and the stakeholders under a co-management framework.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><div class='yrm-btn-wrapper yrm-inline-wrapper yrm-btn-wrapper-3  yrm-more-button-wrapper'><span title='' data-less-title='' data-more-title=''  class='yrm-toggle-expand  yrm-toggle-expand-3' data-rel='yrm-XcAzr' data-more='Show more' data-less='Show less' style='border: none; width: 100%;'><span class=\"yrm-button-text-3 yrm-button-text-span\">Show more<\/span><\/span><\/div><\/p>\n<h3>Climate Change Adaptation Planning and Strategies<\/h3>\n<p>Climate change and climate variability have potential adverse impacts on local biodiversity, fisheries, agriculture and livelihood of people.

We enhance the capacity of the beneficiaries through pertaining skill development training. Such training programs are available on the above mentioned areas of IGA options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revolving fund and saving scheme management, <\/strong>Financial capital is an important element for undertaking livelihood improvement activities. Poor rural communities often constrained by lack of financial capital. Our experiences in a number of resource conservation projects show that providing revolving fund to community had enabled the poor people to undertake income generation activities and achieved tremendous success and brought significant improvement in their livelihood. We propose to set aside a part of the project money as revolving fund to be provided to selected stakeholder group. We will also encourage the fund recipient group to raise their capital stock by savings. This system very well closely monitored and provide backstopping support to the recipient groups. Under SEMP, we provided revolving fund to about 50 group with a total fund of Tk. 25,00,000.00.\u00a0 The program is working well.<\/p>\n<p>In our approach, the poor people are identified and organized into groups and encouraged to make savings.

Similarly, under Coastal and Wetland Biodiversity Project (CWBMP) and CBAECA project of the Department of Environment, we have distributed huge number of cook stoves and biogas plants among coastal people.\u00a0 At present, we have extensive programs on the distribution and promotion of ICS, solar panel and biogas plant among coastal people of Cox\u2019s Bazar.<br \/>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><div class='yrm-btn-wrapper yrm-inline-wrapper yrm-btn-wrapper-3  yrm-more-button-wrapper'><span title='' data-less-title='' data-more-title=''  class='yrm-toggle-expand  yrm-toggle-expand-3' data-rel='yrm-yEHOj' data-more='Show more' data-less='Show less' style='border: none; width: 100%;'><span class=\"yrm-button-text-3 yrm-button-text-span\">Show more<\/span><\/span><\/div><\/p>\n<h3>Promotion of Health and Sanitation Facilities Among Rural Communities (Drinking water and sanitary latrines)<\/h3>\n<p>As an implementation approach for our NRM projects, we promote tube wells and sanitary latrines among rural people and we strongly believe that improvement in health and sanitation is a pre-requisite for socio-economic development of the rural communities. In the past, through our SEMP project, we have promoted\/distributed tube wells and sanitary latrines in the Mymensingh and Manikgonj Districts. We involved the local Union Parishads in the process of promotions of tube wells and sanitary latrines among the local people.\u00a0 Similarly, presently, we are promoting sanitary latrines in Cox\u2019s Bazar areas.<\/p>\n<h3>Awareness Building<\/h3>\n<p>There is no doubt that, in Bangladesh, resource degradation is largely linked to the lack of awareness of the local people about the value of nature and its conservation. The success of any natural resource conservation and management program thus largely depends on the understanding of the local people about the importance and values of nature and its resources, and its linkages to their livelihood, economy and culture, and also on their respect to laws and regulations enacted for natural resource conservation. NACOM always underlines the necessity of enhancement of awareness level of local people for the management of natural resources.<br \/>\n<div class='yrm-content yrm-content-3 yrm-content-hide' id='yrm-EMePL' data-id='3' data-show-status='false' data-after-action=''>\n\t\t\t<div id='yrm-inner-content-yrm-EMePL' class='yrm-inner-content-wrapper yrm-cntent-3'><br \/>\nAs a strategic approach NACOM, in its resource management projects, undertake extensive awareness programs. NACOM is experienced in developing awareness materials and packages on various resource conservation themes and issues. NACOM\u2019s major awareness building activities include: conducting school awareness programs and village awareness meetings, organizing local level nature camp, nature walk and cultural programs on environmental issues, holding rallies, production of leaflets and booklets, holding video shows etc. on various environmental issues and resource conservation.
